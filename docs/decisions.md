# Decision Log

Append-only. Newest at the bottom.
Format: `## YYYY-MM-DD — <decision>` / Context / Decision / Consequence.

## 2026-07-28 — Reconciliation pass applied before M0.1

**Context:** the design docs were written incrementally and later decisions superseded
earlier text that was never updated. Resolved before any code was written.

**Decisions applied:**
1. Lead status enum gains `deferred` (single-thread rule needs a state).
2. `problem_statement` required for inbound only, via CHECK constraint on `source` —
   not a blanket NOT NULL, which would break outbound lead creation.
3. `leads` gains `budget_band`, `budget_source`, `pain_category`, `team_size_band`.
4. Scoring weights rebalanced to five components including `budget_fit: 0.15`.
   Loader asserts the sum is 1.0 at boot.
5. Objection vocabulary gains `handoff` → 8 categories, identical in three files.
6. Prompt frontmatter uses `tier`, never a model name.
7. `qualification/classify_intent.md` does not exist; intent is a sub-score in `score_lead`.
8. Gmail uses polling (`history.list`, ~2 min), not Pub/Sub push. With Slack Socket Mode
   the system needs no public HTTP endpoint.
9. CLAUDE.md gains rule 11 (overrides installed skills) and rule 12 (money is numeric).
10. `agents/sales.py` stays one file until ~400 lines, then splits by lifecycle stage.

**Consequence:** bands (`sql: 78`) must be recalibrated — adding a fifth weighted
component shifts the whole score distribution.

## 2026-07-28 — MCP scope

**Decision:** dev-time yes (Postgres MCP from M0.2, narrow read-only role, local DB only).
Runtime core no — a deterministic pipeline gains nothing from dynamic tool discovery.
Runtime client adapters yes, behind `integrations/` interfaces, triggered by the first
client system we do not natively integrate.

**Consequence:** no MCP packages in `pyproject.toml`. Client adapters land behind
`integrations/crm_external.py` and are additive.
